Starting from the main file -> "Calc.py"

  <li>Click on their corresponding buttons to use their particular formula. It will lead you to a seperate tab</li>
  <li>Enter user input. Press calculate to get the answer in the frame below</li>
  <li>To close the tab click on the cross button in the upper-right corner"</li>
</ul>

  <li>In the "Ionic Strength" tab, you can add as many ions you want (even if you've already hit calculate), until you hit the restart button.</li>
  <li>In the "Standard Free Energy" tab, both Equilibrium Constant and Standard Free Energy can be calculated by entering their counterpart. Inputing both is not allowed.</li>
</ul>
